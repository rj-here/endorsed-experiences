# Endorsed Experiences
A simple website where I am listing some experiences across Ontario that I endorse (go do it once). It simply stemmed from a desire to have a universal recommendations list for my friends. While it's geared for my friends, anyone of you may feel free to take up any recommendation that suits you. I'll update this as and when I see places or recall anywhere I've missed. For the record, I'd like to state that this is not a blog. This is very casual, and to me it's low-level. And, you do not have to necessarily like everything on this list! 
## Niagara Falls
This is an essential spot! You've not been in Ontario if you've not seen this. A stunning waterfall to see. You'll also see the bridge going across to the USA. 
### Niagara Skywheel
Nearby is the skywheel, a fun way to see the falls and the area otherwise too.

## CN Tower
Amongst the tallest buildings, and one of the 7 world wonders, this is also an essential I'd put on the list.
Just to fact check: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower]

## Ripley's Aquarium of Canada
For a different experience, this can be considered! Many things to see, nice vibes.

## Centre Island
Part of the Toronto Islands, this is a nice spot to go! There's rides, food, greenery, and relaxing vibes. The ride to and from the island is also good.

## Belfountain
A nice & relaxing spot to go to. There are some nice spots to go for photos. 2 hours (at the place) would be spent well!

## Blue Mountain Village
A nice "village" with some fun things going on!

## Spencer Smith Park
Seeing water provides a calming effect to me, and that came again at this Burlington spot!

## Sunset Point
Another nice lookout point in Collingwood

## MiMuseum Missisauga
If illusions are your calling, there's this nice museum near Square One & Cineplex Missisauga

## Limehouse Conservation Area
A nice spot to go hike some trails.

## Windsor Riverfront
Seeing the riverfront in Windsor was nice! There's a mini park which was fun. Across, the sight is of Detroit in the USA.

## Coronation Park*
This was a nice park to go to, and see the holiday lights (hence the asterisk).
